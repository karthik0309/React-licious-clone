        "description":"For the meat to stay fresh, and retain its natural juices, It needs to be stored at temperature in  between 0-5. We maintain this temparature from the time we procure the product, to cleaning ,cutting and storing it, until its delevired. And even when its out for delivery we keep it chilled right upto your doorstep"

        "description":"Doesn't everyone do this? Not really. Most other places first weigh the meat, then cut up the pieces, and throw out the parts which aren't fit to eat, such as offal, gizzard, wingtips,  etc. But you still pay based on the original weight eventhough what you finally get is 10% to 30% less. At Licious,we first clean the meat, then cut, then weigh. When you buy1 kg, you will get exactly 1 kg. And that meat will be only the best bits - more meat and less bones. So if we look like we cost a little more than others, it's only because we give you more than others. Thanks for reading. Now you know what we've set out to do and how we're doing it. If you find us slipping, haul us up."
